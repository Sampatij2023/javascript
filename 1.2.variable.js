let name ='Deepak'
let score = 100
//let is used to create variables, javascript is smart enough to know the type of variables
so no need to specify that//

in inverted commas everything is a string
let bonus = '20'
let totalScore = score + bonus
console.log(name)
console.log(totalScore) // prints 10020 i.e., concatenating the strings//

// you can not redeclare a variable//

//logging two valuea at the same time//
 let firstName='Deepak'
 let lastname ='Suthar'
 console.log(firstname + lastName)
 //if you want to give space between them  then see below//
 console.log(firstname +" "+ lastName)
